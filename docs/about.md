# About Bulk Texter Pro
First off, Bulk Texter Pro and Brismuth Apps, LLC are not affiliated in any way with Google or Google Voice.

Now that that's out of the way...

Hi! I'm Brian! üëã

Back in January 2018, I was serving in a volunteer assignment for the [Church of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/), and I needed to regularly text over 100 people about lessons, activities, and other announcements.

At the time I was using Google Voice as my primary phone number, and [Google Voice Bulk Texter](https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter) was born - a free and open source software project that allows you to send personalized texts to a list of people. I shared it on Github, wrote a [blog post](https://brismuth.com/how-to-send-bulk-customized-text-messages-with-google-voice-67b1b5b0ffe7) about it, and helped people as they ran into issues here and there.

Over time, the community grew, and users wanted many more features. But building high quality software takes a lot of work. I wanted to build everything that people were asking for, but it was difficult to find the time (and motivation, if I'm honest) necessary for the massive effort that would be required. 

That's where [Bulk Texter Pro](https://www.bulktexterpro.com/) came in. I decided to rebuild the application from scratch to not only provide a better user experience, but also support complex new features that people frequently requested, such as CSV upload, supporting multiple piped text / variable fields, and allowing messages to be scheduled in advance.

This is kind of an experiment. If people like it, and feel like it's worth the subscription cost ($14.95 a month in exchange for hours of your life back! üòÅ) then I'll keep building new features, and the tool will get better and better!

# Who Uses Bulk Texter Pro / Google Voice Bulk Texter?
School teachers are among the extension's most active users - using the extension to send students information about their grades, or reminders about overdue assignments and upcoming tests.

Many of our users are ecclesiastical leaders or pastors, or volunteers like myself. They use it to send their congregations inspiring messages, or send invites and reminders about activities or lessons.

Some realtors use the extension to send their clients personalized invites to customer appreciation events that they're putting on, or to let them know about new homes on the market that match the criteria they're looking for.

One user reached out to me and thanked me for my work on the extension, and told me that she was using it to organize efforts to fight wildfires in California!

People are doing all kinds of great things with Bulk Texter Pro! 

If you have something neat you're doing with it, I'd love to hear about it. Or if you have any questions, requests, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at support@bulktexterpro.com.

# Updating It
Bulk Texter Pro is now available via the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bulk-texter-pro/kpjadjgajlgmkefnnihfedmcabapnndj). If you previously installed it manually, you can remove it on the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) tab and install it using one of the official links on the [Downloads](/downloads) tab.

If you have already installed Bulk Texter Pro via one of the official web store links, your browser should update to the latest version automatically within 24-48 hours. 

If you want your browser to update to the latest version sooner, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Bulk Texter Pro. Be careful though - you may lose data within the Bulk Texter App by doing this.

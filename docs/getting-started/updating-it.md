# Updating it
The process for updating Bulk Texter Pro is similar to the process for installing it. 

Note that you **must** use the same folder as your existing installation, or you may lose data in Bulk Texter Pro, such as your send history and pending messages.

## Instructions for Updating for Chrome
1. Click "Download for Chrome" on the [Downloads](/downloads) tab 
2. Extract the zip file on your computer
3. Delete the contents of your previously installed Bulk Texter Pro folder (but not the folder itself)
4. Move the contents of your newly extracted folder from step #2 into the existing installation folder from step #3
5. Open chrome://extensions in Chrome
6. Turn on "Developer mode" with the toggle at the top right, if it is not already enabled
7. Click the "refresh" icon at the bottom right of the Bulk Texter Pro card
8. That's it! Your extension should now be fully up to date.

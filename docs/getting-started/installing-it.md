# Installing It

## Instructions for Installing on Chrome
1. Click "Download for Chrome" on the [Downloads](/downloads) tab 
2. Extract the zip file on your computer
3. Move the newly extracted folder to a location where you won't accidentally delete it, and where it will be available when your computer restarts (i.e. not on an external drive or network drive).
4. Open chrome://extensions in Chrome
5. Turn on "Developer mode" with the toggle at the top right
6. Click on "Load Unpacked"
7. Navigate to the extracted project folder from step #3 and select your folder. If you get a "missing manifest" error, make sure you selected folder that contains `manifest.json`, rather than the folder above that.
8. That's it! You should now be able to open Bulk Texter Pro by clicking the puzzle icon at the top right of Chrome, then clicking "Bulk Texter Pro".
9. If desired, you can bookmark the extension page, or click the "pin" icon in the puzzle menu to make Bulk Texter Pro easier to get to.

## Registration
Now that you've installed Bulk Texter Pro, you'll need to register in order to start using it.

If you've never registered before, you can start a free 7 day trial by opening the user profile menu at the top right, and clicking "Start free trial".

Otherwise, you can click "Register" to sign up for a new paid account, or log in to your account if you've registered previously.

Whether you are signing up for a free trial or signing up for a paid account, make sure that the email address you sign up with exactly matches the email address associated with your Google Voice account. Bulk Texter Pro will only work with the account that is registered. If you need to register multiple accounts, you'll need to have a Chrome user profile for each account, and register a copy of Bulk Texter Pro on each one.

## Setting up your computer for Scheduled Messages
To be certain that scheduled messages are sent on time, ensure the following criteria is met:

* Your computer is turned on, unlocked, and is not on a screen saver
* Bulk Texter Pro is installed in a browser that is open and running

Follow these steps to make sure that your computer stays on:
* Disable automatically turning off the screen / sleep mode when on battery
* Disable automatically turning off the screen / sleep mode when plugged in
* Disable automatic screen saver

Generally, the extension will still function if you choose to turn your display brightness all the way down or turn off your desktop monitor, as long as the above criteria is met.

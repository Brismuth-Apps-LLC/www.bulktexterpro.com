# Installing It
The best way to install Bulk Texter Pro is via one of the officially supported web stores - the Chrome web store, the Firefox browser add-on store, or the Edge add-ons store. 

You can find the official links on the [Downloads](/downloads) tab.

# Registration
Now that you've installed Bulk Texter Pro, you'll need to register in order to start using it.

If you've never registered before, you can start a free 7 day trial by opening the user profile menu at the top right, and clicking "Start free trial".

Otherwise, you can click "Register" to sign up for a new paid account, or log in to your account if you've registered previously.

> Note: if the "Register" and "Start free trial" buttons aren't working, see the [relevant section in the FAQ](/docs/faq#the-register-and-start-free-trial-buttons-arent-working).

Whether you are signing up for a free trial or signing up for a paid account, make sure that the email address you sign up with exactly matches the email address associated with your Google Voice account. Bulk Texter Pro will only work with the account that is registered. If you need to register multiple accounts, you'll need to have a Chrome / browser user profile for each account, and register a copy of Bulk Texter Pro on each one.

# Setting up your computer for Scheduled Messages
To be certain that scheduled messages are sent on time, ensure the following criteria is met:

* Your computer is turned on, unlocked, and is not on a screen saver
* Bulk Texter Pro is installed in a browser that is open and running

Follow these steps to make sure that your computer stays on:
* Disable automatically turning off the screen / sleep mode when on battery
* Disable automatically turning off the screen / sleep mode when plugged in
* Disable automatic screen saver

Generally, the extension will still function if you choose to turn your display brightness all the way down or turn off your desktop monitor, as long as the above criteria is met.

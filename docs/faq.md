# FAQ

### How do I install it / set it up?
Check out our guide here: https://www.bulktexterpro.com/docs/getting-started/installing-it

### It says I need to update - how do I update it?
Check out our guide here: https://www.bulktexterpro.com/docs/getting-started/updating-it

### How much does it cost?
$4.95 a month - less than a cheeseburger! üçî 

After installing it, you can sign up for a 7 day free trial - and then decide whether the cost is worth it to you to get hours of your life back!

### How many messages can I send with Bulk Texter Pro?
Bulk Texter Pro does not impose any limits on message sending/frequency beyond what Google Voice imposes. 
We can not comment on Google Voice's limits, as they are not published, and Bulk Texter Pro is not affiliated with Google/Google Voice. 

Bulk Texter Pro is a new product, but Bulk Texter Lite has many users who have been using it for years without issue, because they are not using it for spam - they are using it as teachers, relegious clergy, coaches, etc. 

If you're looking for a solution for prospecting or marketing, Google Voice and Bulk Texter Pro probably aren't a great choice.

### Bulk Texter Pro allows me to schedule messages, but they never send.
* Make sure that your account is registered or you have an active trial
* Make sure that it is up to date
* Make sure that your registered account matches the Google account you are using to send messages. Ideally, that should be the only Google account you are signed into with your chrome user / browser user.

### Some messages sent, but some didn't.
You'll want to go to the History tab in Bulk Texter Pro, and open the batch with the messages that didn't send. There should be an error message next to the messages that failed to send. If you need help troubleshooting, you can email support@bulktexterpro.com.

### Scheduled messages aren't sending unless I schedule them to send right away.
Make sure that your computer is configured to stay awake, and not sleep/hibernate/shut down. Steps for this can vary based on your computer's operating system. See the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-it#setting-up-your-computer-for-scheduled-messages) for some tips.

### My account disappeared!
Click the profile at the top right, then "Register", then click "Log In" and provide the email your previously registered with.

### I'm getting an error that I've signed in too many times, or that I've hit my install limit.
Email support@bulktexterpro.com and we'll help you out.

### Why did the extension stop working?
Occasionally, Google may make changes to Google Voice that stop Bulk Texter Pro from functioning correctly. When this happens, we will update Bulk Texter Pro to support the new changes as quickly as possible. You may be required to manually re-install a new version of Bulk Texter Pro.

### How do I cancel my subscription?
You must have the extension installed in order to manage your subscription. Follow the guide in these docs to install the extension, sign in to your existing account, and click "Manage Subscription" in the user menu.

### Can I use Bulk Texter Pro with multiple Google accounts?
You'll need to use a separate Chrome Profile for each Google Voice user you want to use Bulk Texter Pro with, and register Bulk Texter Pro for each account. BulkTexterPro is only authorized to integrate with the Google Voice account that matches the paid registration.

### When I upload a CSV, it doesn't show all my columns.
Make sure that the very first row in your CSV/spreadsheet is your column headers, and that there aren't any rows above your column headers.

### Will you still be supporting the free version - Bulk Texter Lite / Google Voice Bulk Texter?
Yes - I will make sure that the original feature set continues to function and remains completely free to use. However, the bulk of my development efforts will be spent on improving Bulk Texter Pro.

### Help, I have a question that isn't answered here!

# FAQ

### How do I install it / set it up?
Check out our guide on [getting started](/docs/getting-started/installing-it).

### It says I need to update - how do I update it?
Check out our guide on [updating it](/docs/getting-started/updating-it).

### How much does it cost?
$4.95 a month - less than a cheeseburger! üçî 

After installing it, you can sign up for a 7 day free trial - and then decide whether the cost is worth it to you to get hours of your life back!

### What's the difference between Bulk Texter Pro and Bulk Texter Lite?
You can see a full breakdown on the [Features](/docs/features/) page.

### How many messages can I send with Bulk Texter Pro?
Bulk Texter Pro does not impose any limits on message sending/frequency beyond what Google Voice imposes. 
We can not comment on Google Voice's limits, as they are not published, and Bulk Texter Pro is not affiliated with Google/Google Voice. 

Bulk Texter Pro is a new product, but Bulk Texter Lite has many users who have been using it for years without issue, because they are not using it for spam - they are using it as teachers, relegious clergy, coaches, etc. These users have reported that they can typically send ~50 high quality messages (i.e. not spam) per hour without issue.

If you're looking for a solution for prospecting or marketing, Google Voice and Bulk Texter Pro probably aren't the right choice.

### The "Register" and "Start free trial" buttons aren't working.
Bulk Texter Pro requires access to both https://extensionpay.com/ and https://www.bulktexterpro.com/ in order to function correctly. 

1. Make sure that both sites are working by opening them in your browser.
2. If either of the sites are blocked, you'll need to work with your IT department or network administrator to get them unblocked. The entire domain name should be allowed for each site. 

This should resolve the issue, but if it's still not working, you can email support@bulktexterpro.com. 

### Bulk Texter Pro won't send messages, even when I set them to be sent right away.
* Make sure that your account is registered or you have an active trial.
* Make sure that your registered account matches the Google account you are using to send messages. Ideally, that should be the only Google account you are signed into with your chrome user / browser user.
* Make sure that Bulk Texter Pro is fully [up to date](/docs/getting-started/updating-it/).
* Make sure that both your Google Account and your browser settings are set to English for the Google Voice page. Although text messages can be in any language, Bulk Texter Pro requires that the Google Voice interface be in English.
* Try sending messages manually in Google Voice, without Bulk Texter Pro. If that doesn‚Äôt work either then it‚Äôs an issue with your Google Account or with Google Voice, and not with Bulk Texter Pro. You'll want to work with Google's support team to resolve the issue.

### Some messages sent, but some didn't.
You'll want to go to the History tab in Bulk Texter Pro, and open the batch with the messages that didn't send. There should be an error message next to the messages that failed to send. 

A "confirmSent" error usually indicates that Google Voice is temporary rate limiting or blocking your account, in which case you should refer to our [tips below](/docs/faq/#do-you-have-any-tips-to-avoid-having-my-messages-flagged-as-spam).

If you need help troubleshooting, you can email support@bulktexterpro.com.

### Messages sent right away work, but scheduled messages aren't being sent.
Make sure that your computer is configured to stay awake, and not sleep/hibernate/shut down. Steps for this can vary based on your computer's operating system. See the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-it#setting-up-your-computer-for-scheduled-messages) for some tips.

### Will Bulk Texter Pro run in the background?
If Bulk Texter Pro is in the background, it's possible that your operating system or browser may suspend it, but it's also possible that it will work just fine - give it a try!

Note that Bulk Texter Pro uses your clipboard behind the scenes in order to interact with Google Voice, so you will not be able to use your clipboard while it is actively sending messages.

### My account disappeared!
Click the profile at the top right, then "Register", then click "Log In" and provide the email your previously registered with.

### I'm getting an error that I've signed in too many times, or that I've hit my install limit.
Email support@bulktexterpro.com and we'll help you out.

### Why did the extension stop working?
Occasionally, Google may make changes to Google Voice that stop Bulk Texter Pro from functioning correctly. When this happens, we will update Bulk Texter Pro to support the new changes as quickly as possible.

### How do I cancel my subscription?
You must have the extension installed in order to manage your subscription. Follow the guide in these docs to install the extension, sign in to your existing account, and click "Manage Subscription" in the user menu.

### Can I use Bulk Texter Pro with multiple Google accounts?
Yes! You'll need to use a separate Chrome / browser profile for each Google Voice user you want to use Bulk Texter Pro with, and register Bulk Texter Pro for each account. Bulk Texter Pro is only authorized to integrate with the Google Voice account that matches the paid registration.

### Can I use Bulk Texter Pro with a [Google Workspaces Google Voice](https://workspace.google.com/products/voice/) account?
Yes, you can - and many of our users do!

### How does CSV upload work?
Check out our [documentation on using CSV upload](/docs/getting-started/using-csv-upload).

### When I upload a CSV, it doesn't show all my columns.
Make sure that the very first row in your CSV/spreadsheet is your column headers, and that there aren't any rows above your column headers.

### Will you still be supporting the free version - Bulk Texter Lite / Google Voice Bulk Texter?
Yes - I will make sure that the original feature set continues to function and remains completely free to use. However, the bulk of my development efforts will be spent on improving Bulk Texter Pro.

### Do you have any tips to avoid having my messages being rate limited or blocked?
Here are some ideas that may help:
* This one may seem obvious, but don't send spam. If you're looking for a solution for prospecting or marketing, Google Voice and Bulk Texter Pro probably aren't the right choice.
* Avoid sending more than ~50 messages per hour.
* Ensure that each message is unique (i.e. use names and other variables) and conversational.
* Some users have reported that when recipients are responsive and text back, they are less likely to experience message blocks from Google.
* Some users have reported that removing URLs/website links has helped them - but it often does not cause any problem.
* Try increasing the time between messages, if you're using a shorter delay.
* Longer messages may be more likely to be blocked as well.

### How do I appeal a Google Voice account ban?
We are not affiliated with Google or Google Voice, but you can fill out Google's form here:
